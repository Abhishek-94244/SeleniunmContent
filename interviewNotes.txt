What is Performance Testing?

Performance testing is the general name for tests that check how the system behaves and performs. 
Software performance testing examines responsiveness, stability, scalability, reliability, speed, 
and resource usage of your software and infrastructure.


What is Load Testing

Load testing is a type of performance  in Load testing we check 
how the system behaves when multiple users are trying to engage with it at the same time.

isme ek limit tak end user hote hai 



What is Stress Testing?

A stress test is a type of performance test that checks the upper limits of your system by testing it under extreme loads

isme koi limit nahi hoti hai


What is Functional Testing?

Functional testing is a type of testing which verifies that each function of the software application operates in conformance with the requirement specification.
This testing mainly involves black box testing, and it is not concerned about the source code of the application.

Every functionality of the system is tested by providing appropriate input, verifying the output and comparing the actual results with the expected results. 
This testing involves checking of User Interface, APIs, Database, security, client/ server applications and functionality of the Application Under Test.
The testing can be done either manually or using automation 


What is Non-Functional Testing?

Non-functional testing is a type of testing to check non-functional aspects (performance, usability, reliability, etc.) of a software application. 
It is explicitly designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing.


Key Difference Between Functional Testing and Non Functional Testing

 1 Functional testing verifies each function/feature of the software whereas Non Functional testing verifies non-functional aspects like performance, usability, reliability, etc.
2 Functional testing can be done manually whereas Non Functional testing is hard to perform manually.
3 Functional testing is based on customer’s requirements whereas Non Functional testing is based on customer’s expectations.
4 Functional testing has a goal to validate software actions whereas Non Functional testing has a goal to validate the performance of the software.
 5 A Functional Testing example is to check the login functionality whereas a Non Functional testing example is to check the dashboard should load in 2 seconds.
6 Functional describes what the product does whereas Non Functional describes how the product works.
7 Functional testing is performed before the non-functional testing.
